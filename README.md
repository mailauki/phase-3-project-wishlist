# WishList Project

This is only the frontend of this project.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Description

View a wish list of items you plan to get and your savings goals towards them. See your progress towards items and how much you have saved for them. Add new items to the list, and add new savings balances to have more saved amounts that can be attached to different items to have simultaniously. Edit and delete any items and saved balances. The balances are by default sorted by amount from low to high. The items can be sorted by either price or priority, with price being low to high and priority being highest to lowest.
